# Hundred Days of Code Journey 🚀

Welcome to my coding adventure as I embark on a Hundred Days of Code challenge! 👩‍💻📚

## Introduction

Hey there, fellow coders and enthusiasts! I'm excited to share my journey of growth, learning, and coding with you all. Over the next hundred days, I'm committing to diving deep into coding challenges, with the aim of conquering 3-4 questions every day. From algorithmic puzzles to data structure explorations, I'm ready to tackle it all! 💡✨

But this journey is about more than just solving problems. It's about embracing the process, pushing boundaries, and celebrating consistent effort. I'll be sharing my progress, experiences, and insights right here, from the highs of "aha" moments to the hurdles that test my perseverance. Together, we'll witness the power of dedication and growth in real time. 📊📈

## GitHub Repository

To hold myself accountable and to showcase my progress, I've created a dedicated GitHub repository. You can find it at [Link to Your GitHub Repo](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo). In this repository, you'll discover my solutions to coding challenges, neatly organized and thoroughly documented. Your feedback and support mean the world to me, so feel free to explore the repository and provide your valuable insights. 🌐📂

## Learning Web Development 🌐🎨

But wait, there's more! Alongside coding challenges, I'm embarking on an exciting journey of learning web development. From crafting visually appealing interfaces to building responsive websites, I'm all in. My ambitious goal is to create at least two stunning web projects that truly showcase my skills and creativity. Get ready to witness my evolution in the world of web development!
